**cred** is a Python package that provides reliable, intuitive, and flexible data structures for commercial real estate debt. It is designed to quickly answer common loan- and portfolio-level questions related to payment schedules, prepayment costs, dates, and scenario analytics. The package includes convenience functions for common loan structures, but the modularized construction enables comprehensive customization of interest calculations, amortization, prepayment functions, or any other aspect of the debt instrument in question.
